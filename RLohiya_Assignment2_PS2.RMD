#Problem set 2:

Matrix factorization is a very important problem. There are supercomputers built just to do matrix factorizations. Every second you are on an airplane, matrices are being factorized. Radars that track flights use a technique called Kalman filtering. At the heart of Kalman Filtering is a Matrix Factorization operation. Kalman Filters are solving linear systems of equations when they track your flight using radars. Write an R function to factorize a square matrix A into LU or LDU, whichever you prefer.

```{r}
my_func = function(M){
  
  if(dim(M)[1]!=dim(M)[2]){
    return('Stop!! Not a square matrix')
  }
  
   rows = columns = dim(M)[1]

  U = M
  L = D =  diag(rows)
 
   for (j in 1:(columns-1)){
       for (i in (j+1):rows){
         L[i,j] = (U[i,j]/U[j,j])
      U[i,] = U[i,]-(U[j,]*L[i,j])
    }
  }
 
  diag(D) = diag(U)
  for (l in 1:rows){
    U[l,] = U[l,]/U[l,l]
  }
  
  LDU = list(L,D,U)
return(LDU)
  
}
M = matrix(c(1,3,6,2,3,5,-1,7,-3),nrow=3,ncol = 3)
my_func(M)
```
